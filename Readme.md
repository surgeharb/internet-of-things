# IOT

You can find the code all written in Typescript with the help of johnny-five to translate JavaScript to the machine language. All you need to do is to clone the project, mount the breadboard and the Arduino board with the required pins as mentioned in the configuration file, run npm install (of course after having Node.js installed on your machine), navigate to the root of the project and type:
 - node index “disco” to run disco white light
 - node index “traffic” to run traffic light system
 - node index “rgbled” to run rgled module and in your browser localhost:5555
